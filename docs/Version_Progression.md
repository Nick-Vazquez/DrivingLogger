# Version Progression

This application will go through many iterations and versions throughout its 
lifecycle. This document aims to device project milestones and versioning goals.

## Timeline
The bulk development of this project has been done throughout the Fall 2022 
Semester by Gigi Harrabi. The aim of this initial development was to do research
on loggers and set up environments for basic testing strategies.

We would like to deploy this software for team use before the start of the 2022 
driving season. Eventually this app should be able to be used by any member of 
the team during caravan driving to keep track of events and provide more insight
into how the team performs.
